From The Odin Project's Web Development 101: (http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

This project will be demonstrating how to deconstruct an existing webpage and 
rebuild it using the tools and skills we have studied thus far in The Odin Project:
HTML, CSS, Git, basic Javascript, and Developer Tools.

Skills demonstrated:

1. Convert inline HTML elements to 'block' or 'inline-block' in order to center horizontally with CSS
2. Center images and forms horizontally with CSS
3. Use the 'position' property to pull box elements out of the normal flow of HTML
4. Use the 'float' property to take boxes from #3 and move them to either side of the page
5.
